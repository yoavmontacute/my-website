        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>
          There is a remarkable divide in the field of logic in Computer Science between
          two distinct strands: one focuses on semantics and compositionality (“Structure”),
          the other on expressiveness and complexity (“Power”).
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that bringing these communities together is an important objective.
          Previous workshops were held at LiCS 2021–2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a LiCS 2026 affiliated workshop. It will be a hybrid event, with on-site
          participation strongly encouraged.
